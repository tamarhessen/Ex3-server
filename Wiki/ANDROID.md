# Run on android

Download the git repo from: https://github.com/tamarhessen/Ex2---android.git

Go to android studio, there click on the green button, and hopefully you are done.

If you are not you probably had the bug saying "couldn't fund sdk" to fix it:

go to - build.gradle.kts (in Gradle Scripts) and press open then OK

And you are done.
