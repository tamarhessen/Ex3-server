# Using the app

## So, you are finally ready to use the app?

Great! let me walk you through it.

I will assume the server is running, and the bloom filter is running.

This would be a walk through to the web app, using the android app is the same and very intuitive.

Open the web app in http://localhost:5000, you should see this screen:
